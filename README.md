# group_project_app2_employeesProject

This was a group project assignment working with server calls to a database for employee information
and displaying and manipulating that information on the DOM. The employee information in the database 
had been generated in a previous project. Pushing the DELETE and FREEZE button involved sending calls 
back to the database to eitherremove or flag the employee information and then update 
the information displayed on the DOM.
